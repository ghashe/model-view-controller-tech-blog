## Description

This is a full stack web application that uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm to create <br/>
a blog-style website where users can create an account, edit their information, make posts, edit posts, <br/>
and comment on other user's posts. Users can view posts and visit links as a visitor, create their own <br/>
account, and as an authenticated user they can add their own posts and comment on other posts as well. <br/>
They can edit titles and content or delete their own posts as well.
